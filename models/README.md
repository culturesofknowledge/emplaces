# Linked data model for EMPlaces

This directory contains [diagrams](PDFs) and [documentation](20180405-EMPlaces-data-model-notes.md) of a proposed linked data model for EMPlaces.

NOTE: this is WORK-IN-PROGRESS, and NOT FINAL.

(In due course, the documentation itself will be moved into this page)


# TODO

- [ ] Finish assembling example data for Opole
- [ ] Decide how to flag "core data" in structures used for both core and additional data (needed for refresh of core data from source).
- [ ] Decide on structure for place categories and annotation types (thinking of using RDF (sub)types for these)
- [ ] Check that proposed Web Annotation extensions don't break anything
- [ ] Pin down location/timespan vocabularies (the structure here follows ideas from Topotime/GeoJSON-LDT (also a work-in-progress?) but the vocabularies haven't yet been checked.)
- [ ] Update [Data model notes](./20180405-EMPlaces-data-model-notes.md); resolve any remaining TODOs there
- [ ] Update [diagrams](./PDFs/)
- [ ] Crosswalk between UI and data model
- [ ] ...
