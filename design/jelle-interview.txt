PhD cultural history @IISH: labour migration in early-modern Europe.
Postdoc @Cambridge: history of population and social structures.
Compared two migrations systems: English (particularly London) and Dutch (particularly Amsterdam).

ArcGIS mostly.

Can you give some examples of some searches you dit to some historical places. Prize papers. Privateering.

What was the information you had about this place?
--------------------------------------------------

Where were you born (captured seaman)? Could be extremely specific or general. Usually really specific. They ofte use the English version or a transription of the "sound" in English.

Place name. Many variants. Gazetter built based on that.
Location. Added from GeoNames and standardized to FGMaps by Lodeweg.

Do you wish you had additional information you couldn't find in GN or other non-historical gazetteers? 

Variants
Location
Feature

Non eistent places/uncertain. The most problematic is to make a choice. Historical apopulation size can help disambiguate (usually assign to the biggest place).
Something like 20% unknown/uncertain on average, depending on the project.

Spatial analysis ArcGIS:

- Heatmaps
- Buffer analysis (distance to coasts, distance to river, ...)

Spatial distribution/concentration

Other sources. Specific interst in variants that help with the reconciliation process. Dutch historical gazzetteer he cannot remember the name of. Dates are essential.

Maps/cartograms
---------------

Completely nonsense when people get stressed out about a particular border being drawn precisely. Borders do not really matter that much. Maps more about communication.
More in general making a map is useful fo storytelling. Borders are ot that important.
