# Design Notes

This directory contains rough notes and working descriptions of the design and fuctionality of EM Places. 

[Display][1] provides an overview of key concepts and principles, then describes the functionality of the gazetteer by reviewing the interface for a single place record. [Search][2] offers a review of several potential approaches to searching and browsing place records. [Edit][3] contains rough notes on editorial workflows.

N.B.: All sections are WORK-IN-PROGRESS and will periodically be out of sync with parallel work on the gazetter's data model and technical infrastructure.
