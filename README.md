# EM Places
Early Modern Places (EM Places) is a historical geo-gazetteer under development by the [Cultures of Knowledge][1] project at Oxford University. It is the first of what will eventually become [three Linked Open Data resources][2] also comprising Early Modern People and Early Modern Dates built on a [shared humanities infrastructure platform][3] in collaboration with the [Huygens Institute][4] (KNAW) in Amsterdam. 

## Goals
EM Places is being designed to meet four goals: 

The first is to be __a resource for identifying early modern places__ by means of their current and historical name variants. To this end, EM Places will combine current place (and alternative) place names, a current political/administrative hierarchy and location data from one or more reference gazetteers (e.g. GeoNames, TGN Getty) and extend this with additional name attestations provided by contributors from other historical sources (e.g. manuscripts).

The second is to provide __a means for researchers to contribute additional historical contexts for places__. Initially, this will consist of means for recording, i) basic data (e.g. name, period, related resources, bibliography) for the administrative, ecclesiastical, military, and judicial hierarchies associated with a historical place, and ii) data on the dominant calendars (e.g. Julian, Gregorian) in use. In the future, EM Places may be extended with further support for further features, such as early modern postal routes.

The third is to __properly credit, source, and cite all contributions__ to the gazetteer by individual researchers and project teams and provide means to link to other, associated resources. Contributing users with registered accounts on EM Places will be able to submit or amend data using either a web interface or via a bulk upload facility. Editorial users will have means to review these contributions. Place records in the gazetteer will be accompanied by bibliographical entries, related resources and a facility to link back to other early modern collections sharing their records as Linked Open Data.

The fourth is to __make the EM Places source code and datasets easily accessible and reusable by others__. To this end, the EM Places  source code, which will be based on the Huygens Institute's [Timbuctoo][5] technical infrastructure will be shared under open source and made accessible for reuse. All data in EM Places will be shared under open access over multiple channels: in the form of user initiated exports from the EM Places applications itself and as periodic data dumps to external repositories in common formats, and via the EM Places public API. In addition, EM Places will be able to share its data in the [Pelagios Gazetteer Interconnection Format][6] and able to respond to API queries via the [Peripleo][7] standard. 

Our intent is to prepare  EM Places, as much as possible, in transparent and collaborative manner, which will best allow it to be a useful resource for the   [Pelagios Community][8] and a participant in the proposed [Linked Pasts Network][9].

## Design
The draft [design documents][10] offer an informal description of the planned features for EM Places together with a first set of interface mock-ups. More details will be added here as the gazetteerâ€™s features are finalized.

## Data Model
An early draft of the [proposed data model][11] for EM Places and a set of data model diagrams. More details will be added here as the data model set is finalized.

## Status
**April 2018**: First public draft of the design document describing the proposed features of the gazetteer with schematic mock-ups of potential UI elements. First public draft of the overview data model document. 

**March 2018**: Private drafts of the gazetter's design document and data model.

## Next ToDo Items
- Collect and incorporate community feedback
- Fix the main v.1 features of the gazetteer; revise documentation
- Test data model with sample data
- Update data model; revise documentation
- Refine the proposed search interface
- Discuss editorial workflows; create initial interface mockups
