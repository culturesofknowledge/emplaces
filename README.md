# EM Places
Early Modern Places (EM Places) is a historical geo-gazetteer for the sixteenth- to eighteenth-century under development by the [Cultures of Knowledge][1] project at Oxford University. It is the first of what will eventually become [three Linked Open Data resources][2] also comprising EM People and EM Dates built on a [shared humanities infrastructure platform][3] in collaboration with the [Huygens Institute][4] (KNAW) in Amsterdam. 

## Goals
EM Places is being designed to meet four goals: 

The first is to be __a resource for identifying early modern places__ by means of their current and historical name variants. To this end, EM Places will combine current place (and alternative) place names, a current administrative hierarchy and location data from reference gazetteers and extend this with additional name attestations provided by contributors from other historical sources (e.g. manuscripts). Users will be able to browse and search for places on multiple criteria, refine their results over facets, and export their search results. 

The second is to provide __a means for researchers to contribute additional historical contexts for places__. Initially, this will consist of means for recording, i) basic data (e.g. name, period, related resources, bibliography) for the administrative, ecclesiastical, military, and judicial hierarchies associated with a historical place, and ii) data on the dominant calendars (e.g. Julian, Gregorian) in use. In the future, EM Places may be extended with further support for further features, such as early modern postal routes.

The third is to __credit, source, and cite all contributions__ to the gazetteer by individual researchers and project teams and provide means to link to other, associated resources. Contributing users with registered accounts on EM Places will be able to submit or amend data using either a web interface or via a bulk upload facility. Editorial users will have means to review these contributions. Place records in the gazetteer will be accompanied by bibliographical entries, related resources and a facility to link back to other early modern collections sharing their records as Linked Open Data.

The fourth is to __make the EM Places source code and datasets easily accessible and reusable by others__. To this end, the EM Places source code, based on the Huygens’ [Timbuctoo][5] technical infrastructure, will be shared under open source and made accessible for reuse. All data in EM Places will be shared under open access over multiple channels: in the form of user initiated exports from the applications itself, on external repositories, and via the EM Places API. Separately, EM Places will be able to respond to share its data in the [Pelagios Gazetteer Interconnection Format][6] API queries over the [Peripleo][7] standard. Our intent is to have EM Places be a productive resource for the Pelagios Community and an active participant in the proposed Linked Pasts Network.

Our intent is to prepare EM Places in a transparent and collaborative manner as possible to allow it to become a useful resource for the   [Pelagios Community][8] and an active participant in the proposed [Linked Pasts Network][9].

## Design
The draft [design documents][10] offer an informal description of the planned features for EM Places together with a first set of interface mock-ups. More details will be added here as the gazetteer’s features are finalized.

## Data Model
An early draft of the [proposed data model][11] for EM Places and a set of data model diagrams. More details will be added here as the data model set is finalized.

## Status
**April 2018**: First public draft of the design document describing the proposed features of the gazetteer with schematic mock-ups of potential UI elements. First public draft of the overview data model document. 

**March 2018**: Private drafts of the gazetter's design document and data model.

## Next ToDo Items
- Collect and incorporate community feedback
- Fix the main v.1 features of the gazetteer; revise documentation
- Test data model with sample data
- Update data model; revise documentation
- Refine the proposed search interface
- Discuss editorial workflows; create initial interface mockups
