# GeoNames core data extractor for EMPlaces

## TODO

- [x] add common definitions to output (optionally)
- [x] support multiple extractions in one command, reading from stdin
- [x] command to generate list of places in admin hierarchy for a place
- [x] command to generate hierarchy closure for supplied list of places
- [x] review place type labelling (currently uses label from GeoNames ontology file)
- [ ] get_geonames_data.py:  Pull text about place from Wikipedia (1st paragraph of text)

Maybe later:

- [ ] Installation script (setup.py)
